# Analysis of Marketing Campaign Results

# Overview

## Background
Freedom Debt Relief is an organization that helps individuals who have accrued significant debt as a result of unexpected hardship and are no longer able to meet their minimum monthly requirements. Upon enrolling in Freedom’s Debt Relief program, customers cease making payments to their creditors and instead make deposits they can afford into a new dedicated bank account with Freedom. Freedom uses these funds to negotiate with each of the client’s creditors to settle the debt, typically at only a fraction of what was originally owed. Freedom collects fees (proportional to the monthly deposited amount) from the client for agreements it successfully negotiates.

## Objectives
Freedom recently ran a marketing campaign to promote their debt relief program. The cost of the campaign was $5 million. The overarching goal of this project is to:

1. Provide a quantitative assessment of whether the marketing campaign was successful. Explain why these metrics were choosen.

2. Recommend ways the campaign strategy can be adjusted in the future to improve performance.
