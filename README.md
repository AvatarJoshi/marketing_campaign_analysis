## Objectives
Using the three datasets given:

1. Provide a quantitative assessment of whether the marketing campaign was successful. How and why did you choose your specific success metric(s)?
2. Based on the provided data, how would you recommend campaign strategy be adjusted in the future to improve performance?
3. How do you think campaign performance would have changed if we did not run the campaign in Month 3, but instead postponed it until month 6? Provide an incremental number versus your result in Question #1.
